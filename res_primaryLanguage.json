    "description": "I'm currently an undergraduate student at UBC, exploring concepts in computer science, data science, and psychology. As a Cognitive Systems student, I was able to take classes in many different disciplines, learning different perspectives and how to reconcile them to form a bigger, more complete picture of a multitude of areas, from AI development and analysis to the interactions between humans and computers. Beyond university, I am a passionate and curious individual, always looking for new opportunities to learn more about the world around us, and a video game enthusiast who loves getting lost in digital worlds, constantly trying to understand better how they can be so great at what they do.",

Our study was conducted over two weeks on UBC Open Kitchen, where over 2000 observations were collected in conjunction with quantitative data around food waste and foot traffic in the dining hall. Afterwards, data analysis was performed using R, where the data was cleaned, wrangled, and analyzed using Whitney-Mann U and Wilcoxon tests. Lastly, a report followed by a presentation was conducted for our client, providing recommendations for the future. I worked in study and graphic design, data collection and analysis, report and paper writing, and performed the presentation.",
