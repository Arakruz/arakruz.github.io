In this project, players cast spells by drawing on the screen as they explore a fantasy world. As a systems programmer, I implemented day-night cycles, developed in-editor tools to streamline the development process, and designed player-environment and player-enemy interactions. Additionally, I created a modular spell system that enabled non-programmer developers to create new features without coding, allowing for rapid prototyping and enhanced gameplay variety.",

Over two weeks, we collected over 2000 observations at UBC Open Kitchen, analyzing data on food waste and foot traffic using R. My role included designing the study materials, collecting and analyzing data, and writing the final report.
